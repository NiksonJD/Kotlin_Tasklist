This is the Tasklist project I made myself.

It's always good to have something that can remind you about important tasks. It may be simple paper notes or a sophisticated app. In this project, you will create a text-based program that shows tasks, deadlines, and priorities.

Learning outcomes
You'll learn how to handle input, output, lists, and files. Moreover, you'll get to know the basics of JSON which is the most popular data interchange format. For the latter, you will use appropriate Kotlin libraries.
